# Bank Marketing Prediction


## Overview

This project predicts whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost). It evaluates models based on Test F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and F1-Score Gap, storing results in a DataFrame for comparison.

Features: age, job, marital, education, default, balance, housing, loan, contact, month, poutcome, p_recency

Target: deposit (0 = no, 1 = yes)
